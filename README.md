# Graduate_Analysis

'Dataset.csv' is an optimised dataset for the SVM machine learning method. Changes made to the dataset are:

Remove the columns, 'GDP', 'Unemployment rate' and 'Inflation rate'.
Remove enrolled students from the 'Target' column.
Binarise the 'Target' column, so Graduate = 1 and Dropout = 0
Ensured that all values were numerical and such allowed SVM to be done.
